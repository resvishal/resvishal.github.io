I am a **Project Associate** at the [CSIR–Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology (CSIR-IHBT)](http://www.ihbt.res.in/en/) and completed my **M.Sc. in Bioinformatics** at the [Department of Bioinformatics, Pondicherry University](https://bicpu.edu.in/).  

My research focuses on **computational approaches to understand disease mechanisms and protein–ligand interactions**. I apply molecular dynamics simulations, molecular docking, free energy calculations, and structure-based drug design to explore how small molecules can modulate biological targets.  

During my master’s thesis, I investigated the **dengue virus NS2B/NS3 protease**, using docking and molecular dynamics to identify potential allosteric binding sites and evaluate ligand stability. This experience strengthened my interest in structural bioinformatics and the role of computation in advancing therapeutic discovery.  

Beyond technical skills, I am driven by a deep **curiosity for scientific inquiry**—to ask precise questions, explore hidden mechanisms of biology, and translate computational insights into meaningful solutions. I believe in combining **structural bioinformatics, creativity, and persistence** to contribute to both fundamental science and real-world health challenges.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). 
You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. 
You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. 
Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. 
This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
