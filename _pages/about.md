I am a **Project Associate at CSIR–Institute of Himalayan Bioresource Technology (CSIR-IHBT)**.  
My research is focused on **computational drug discovery** against *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.  
I use a range of **in-silico techniques** including:

- Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations  
- Molecular Docking  
- Free Energy Calculations  
- Structure-based Drug Design approaches  

My work involves exploring **protein–ligand interactions, drug resistance mechanisms, and therapeutic target validation**.  
I also integrate **bioinformatics, cheminformatics, and structural biology** to enhance the drug discovery pipeline.  

**Research Interests**  
- Drug discovery for tuberculosis (TB)  
- Computational biology and molecular simulations  
- Structure-based drug design  
- Mechanisms of drug resistance in pathogenic proteins  

**Future Goals**  
- Advance expertise in **computational drug design**  
- Collaborate with interdisciplinary teams for **novel therapeutic development**  
- Contribute to addressing **global health challenges** like tuberculosis
